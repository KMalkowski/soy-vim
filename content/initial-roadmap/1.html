	<h2>Stupid Macos feature</h2>
	Moving around with h,j,k,l is great but there is this one funny thing that can entirely fuck up
	your experience with it. It's this "feature" in macos that when you hold on to some keys displays
	options of special characters istead of repeating a key. <br />
	<br />
	Check if the case with your setup by holding on to the l key and see what happens, are you going
	fast to the right? If not you can disable this thing by running this command in your terminal:
	<br />
	<br />
	<code>defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false</code> <br />
	<br />
	Now you can move around with h,j,k,l without any issues.
	<h2>Key repeat rate</h2>
	You can also increase or decrease the key repeat rate in your system settings. For Macos it's
	under the Settings -> Keyboard -> Key Repeat Rate. Adjust it to your liking! <br />
	<br />
	Now you can move around with h,j,k,l without any issues.
